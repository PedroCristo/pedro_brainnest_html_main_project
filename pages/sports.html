            <h2> Sports</h2>
            <div>
                <h4> Bodyboard </h4>
                <p> I used to practice bodyboarding extensively in my hometown of Portugal, and I still 
                    follow the competitions closely. Bodyboarding offers a unique combination of physical 
                    activity, excitement, and connection with nature. The sport requires balance, control,
                     and skill to maneuver the board, making it an excellent way to stay in shape and improve 
                     overall fitness. The adrenaline rush of riding a wave and the sensation of gliding on 
                     water is unparalleled. Additionally, spending time in the ocean observing the waves, sea 
                     life, and feeling the power of the water is a special and unique experience. It can be 
                     alming and therapeutic for the mind, body, and soul.
                </p>

                <h4> Gym </h4>
                <p> In Ireland, I frequently visit the gym as it is an activity that brings me great pleasure. 
                    Not only is it a great way to improve overall health and well-being, but it also provides 
                    the opportunity to work on maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. 
                    Additionally, it helps to improve overall fitness levels and body composition. On certain days, I 
                    also take the time to enjoy a refreshing swim in the pool. Exercise, especially cardio such as cycling 
                    or running and weightlifting, can help to burn calories and achieve weight loss. Furthermore, resistance 
                    training with weights can help increase muscle mass, which can have a positive impact on metabolism and make 
                    it easier to burn calories and maintain weight loss.
